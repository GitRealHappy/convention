          <summary>The Concept</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>The contest would run alongside the 8-week Future-Proof Workshop Series (leading to the June 5–7 summit). <strong>The workshop series itself is free</strong> — anyone can attend any of the live calls at no cost. To <strong>enter the contest</strong>, participants would need a GA or VIP ticket to the summit and would post after each workshop. The contest would reward the one who demonstrates the <strong>most visible transformation</strong> across all 8 weeks.</p>
            <p>Contestants would post a reel on Instagram or a short on YouTube after each workshop, describing how they're applying what they learned. No application form — eligibility would be verified through tagged posts. At the end of the series, the workshop speakers would review the eligible entries and vote on a single winner. This is a working draft; I'm open to simplifying if it feels like too much.</p>
            <p>The winner is announced on <strong>May 2nd</strong>, one week after the final workshop (not on stage at the convention).</p>

          <summary>The Prize</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p><strong>If the winner has a GA ticket:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>Free upgrade to VIP (<strong>$700 value</strong> — the difference between GA at $299 and VIP at $999)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>If the winner already has a VIP ticket:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>A free VIP ticket to bring a friend (<strong>$999 value</strong>). Their friend gets the full VIP experience alongside them.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In both cases, the prize is worth $700–$999 USD and deepens the winner's connection to the summit community.</p>
            <p><strong>VIP includes:</strong> exclusive Saturday dinner with speakers, front-row seating, after-party ticket, and 2 years of Premium Living Internet University membership.</p>

          <summary>How Participants Enter</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p><strong>Anyone can join the workshop series for free</strong> and attend any live call at no cost. To <strong>enter the contest</strong>, participants must:</p>
            <ol>
              <li><strong>Hold a GA or VIP ticket</strong> to the Future-Proof Creator Summit (June 5–7, 2026).</li>
              <li><strong>Attend each of the 8 workshops</strong> — either live or by watching the recorded replay.</li>
              <li><strong>Post a reel on Instagram or a video on YouTube</strong> after each workshop, describing how they are applying what they learned in their own life or business.</li>
              <li><strong>Tag</strong> <code>#livinginternetuniversity</code> and <code>@living.internet.alliance</code> in every post.</li>
              <li><strong>Post for all 8 workshops</strong> — missing even one disqualifies the entry.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Eligibility would be verified through the tagged posts. I might also ask participants to submit a simple form at the end with links to all 8 posts to make speaker review easier.</p>

        <details>
          <summary>How the Winner Is Selected</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>At the end of the 8-week series, the workshop speakers would review the eligible entries and vote on <strong>one winner</strong> based on a single criterion:</p>
            <blockquote style="margin: 1rem 0; padding: 1rem; background: rgba(8,141,206,0.08); border-left: 4px solid var(--fire); font-style: italic;">Most visible transformation across the 8 weeks.</blockquote>
            <p>I'd be looking for:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Genuine, honest documentation of their journey (not polished production)</li>
              <li>Real-world application of what they learned — not just summaries</li>
              <li>Evidence of growth, breakthroughs, and honest struggle</li>
              <li>A story arc that shows who they were in week 1 vs. who they are in week 8</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Tie-breaking:</strong> If speakers are split, the series host casts the deciding vote.</p>
            <p>The winner is announced on <strong>May 2nd</strong>, one week after the final workshop (not on stage at the convention).</p>

            <p>Live Saturday morning workshops at 11:00am PST, 60–90 minutes each (45–60 min teaching + 15–30 min Q&A). <strong>Anyone can participate in the series for free</strong> and attend any call live; recorded replays are available for summit ticket holders. A couple of speakers have confirmed their slot — this schedule is a place for others to confirm or adjust.</p>

          <summary>What I'm Asking of You</summary>
          <div class="accordion-body">
            <p>At the end of the 8-week series (Week 9), I'd send you the eligible entries — likely a shortlist with links to each participant's 8 posts. One idea is that you'd review them and cast a single vote for the participant who, in your view, showed the <strong>most visible transformation</strong> across the 8 weeks.</p>
            <p>I'm not looking for the most polished content — I'm looking for the most honest journey: real application of what was taught, evidence of growth, and a clear story arc from week 1 to week 8.</p>
            <p>I might also give 2nd and 3rd place a shout-out at the summit (with runner-up prize) to reward effort; your votes would help identify those finalists.</p>
            <p>I'd welcome your feedback on whether this structure works or if it's too much to ask.</p>
