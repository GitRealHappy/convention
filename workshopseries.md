---

## The Sequencing Logic
The sequence follows a complete arc from vision to mastery, with a crucial middle layer of self and brain science that most business workshops skip entirely:
1. **Vision** — Understand what it means to build your life's work
2. **Business** — Design something worth selling
3. **Self** — Understand yourself and your unique perspective
4. **Brain** — Rewire yourself for execution and growth
5. **Audience** — Build visibility and reach
6. **Craft** — Master the medium
7. **Ease** — Operate from effortless effectiveness
8. **Mastery** — Turn your philosophy into a sold-out offer
---
## Recommended 8-Week Sequence
### **WEEK 1: "Your Life's Work" — Dan Koe**
**Topic:** The Philosophy of Authentic Creative Work
**Why First:** Dan sets the meta-level vision. He reframes what it means to be a "creator" and establishes that the series is about pursuing your life's work, not chasing trends. This is the North Star for everything that follows.
**What Participants Learn:**
- The difference between influencers, content creators, and authentic creators
- Why having a positive aim (vision) is the foundation
- The four pillars of creative work: brand, content, product, promotion
- How to think about your work as a system, not isolated tactics
**What They Should Have After:** Clarity on what "life's work" means to them; a sense of permission to pursue something meaningful
**Transition to Week 2:** "Now that you know what you're building toward, let's understand the business architecture that makes it sustainable."
---
### **WEEK 2: "Build Your Offer" — Taylin Simmonds**
**Topic:** The Business Architecture of a Sustainable Creative Business
**Why Here:** Taylin teaches the meta-level business thinking that most creators skip. He breaks down the macro/micro flywheel, shows how to structure offers for profitability, and shares his transparent approach to revenue. This is where participants move from "I have something to offer" to "Here's how I'll actually make money."
**What Participants Learn:**
- The macro/micro offer flywheel (high-ticket + low-ticket)
- How to position yourself for premium pricing
- The three paths to earning as a creator (content copywriting, service-based business, newsletter ghostwriting)
- How to think about business architecture, not just tactics
- Real numbers: what works, what doesn't, and why
**What They Should Have After:** A clear offer structure; understanding of their monetization path; confidence that they can build a sustainable business
**Transition to Week 3:** "With your vision and business architecture in place, let's go deeper into yourself to understand what you're uniquely positioned to offer."
---
### **WEEK 3: "Face Yourself" — David Morin**
**Topic:** The Existential Foundation of Building Something Real
**Why Here:** Before participants build an audience or refine their craft, they need to confront the internal barriers—fear, self-doubt, imposter syndrome, judgment. David's work with incarcerated men using poetry as medicine shows he understands transformation at the deepest level. By placing this after the vision and business work, participants have context for why this self-work matters.
**What Participants Learn:**
- How to use self-inquiry and existential work to uncover your true voice
- The relationship between fear and authenticity
- How building a business forces you to confront yourself
- Practical tools for moving through resistance
**What They Should Have After:** Deeper self-awareness; permission to be themselves; clarity on what they're actually afraid of; renewed commitment to their vision and offer
**Transition to Week 4:** "Now that you've done the inner work, let's understand the neuroscience behind how you actually change — and how to rewire your brain for the execution ahead."
---
### **WEEK 4: "Rewire Your Brain" — Kimia Nora**
**Topic:** Neuroplasticity & Brain-Based Foundations for Creators
**Why Here:** Kimia's work on applied neuroscience and neuroplasticity serves as a powerful bridge between the self-work (David) and the execution work (Hussain, Logan). After confronting their fears and patterns in week 3, participants need to understand how the brain actually changes — and how to use that knowledge to build new habits, overcome resistance, and show up consistently.
**What Participants Learn:**
- How neuroplasticity works and why it matters for creators and entrepreneurs
- Brain-based tools for overcoming resistance and building momentum
- How to use neuroscience to support health, focus, and creative output
- The relationship between nervous system regulation and business success
**What They Should Have After:** A science-backed understanding of how they change; practical tools for rewiring their patterns; renewed confidence that growth is possible
**Transition to Week 5:** "With your brain primed for growth, let's put it to work — here's how to build an audience that actually wants what you're selling."
---
### **WEEK 5: "Build Your Audience" — Hussain Ibarra**
**Topic:** High-Quality Content and Audience Building Frameworks
**Why Here:** Hussain brings tactical execution. After the philosophy (Dan K), the business architecture (Taylin), the self-work (David), and the brain science (Kimia), participants are ready to execute. Hussain teaches structure and frameworks — the concrete "how" that people who are stuck or plateaued desperately need.
**What Participants Learn:**
- Frameworks for writing high-quality content
- How to build an audience from zero (or grow an existing one)
- The relationship between content quality and audience trust
- Tactical steps to implement immediately
**What They Should Have After:** A content strategy; confidence in their ability to build an audience; concrete next steps
**Transition to Week 6:** "You have an audience strategy. Now let's master the craft of visual storytelling and embodied presence in your content."
---
### **WEEK 6: "Master Your Craft" — Logan Quinn**
**Topic:** Visual Storytelling and Embodied Presence in Content
**Why Here:** Logan brings the craft layer. By this point, participants have philosophy, business architecture, self-knowledge, brain science, and audience strategy. Now they need to level up the quality of their execution. Logan's background in film, body work, and performance teaches them how to create content that lands emotionally and visually.
**What Participants Learn:**
- How to use visual storytelling to communicate your message
- The role of embodied presence in content creation
- Practical film/production principles for creators
- How to make your content feel alive and intentional
**What They Should Have After:** A visual content strategy; understanding of how to use their body and presence as a tool; elevated production quality
**Transition to Week 7:** "You've built the skills. Now let's learn how to operate from a place of ease and effortless effectiveness so you can sustain this long-term."
---
### **WEEK 7: "Effortless Effectiveness" — Dan Goldfield**
**Topic:** Letting Go of Striving and Operating from Natural Clarity
**Why Here:** By week 7, participants have done the work — they have vision, business architecture, self-knowledge, brain science, audience strategy, and craft skills. But many will be running on fumes, caught in the hustle mentality. Dan teaches them how to "debug" the buggy mental/emotional processes that drain high-performers and operate from a place of ease.
**What Participants Learn:**
- Why striving harder doesn't work (and what does)
- The "Control-Alt-Delete" protocol for managing anxiety and overwhelm
- How to access your natural clarity and relaxation
- Systems-level thinking about effectiveness
- How to scale without burning out
**What They Should Have After:** A sense of ease about their journey; tools for managing the mental/emotional challenges of building; understanding that effectiveness comes from letting go, not pushing harder
**Transition to Week 8:** "Now that you know how to operate from ease, let's see what's possible when you bring all of this together — and turn your life philosophy into a sold-out offer."
---
### **WEEK 8: "Deeper Living: From Philosophy to Sold-Out Course" — Olivia Peers**
**Topic:** Self-Actualization and Turning Your Life Philosophy into a Transformative Offer
**Why Last:** Olivia is the perfect capstone. She embodies everything the series has been building toward — she took her life philosophy ("Deeper Living OS"), turned it into a sold-out human potential course with a 100% close rate and life-changing results, and used the creator economy to do it. Participants leave the series seeing what's possible when you combine all 8 layers.
**What Participants Learn:**
- How to turn a life philosophy or unique perspective into a transformative offer
- The creator economy as a vehicle for human potential education
- How to achieve extraordinary close rates through genuine transformation
- What self-actualization looks like in practice — for you and your clients
- The full arc: from idea to sold-out course
**What They Should Have After:** Inspiration and a concrete model for what's possible; clarity on how their own philosophy or perspective can become an offer; excitement about the summit as the next step
**Closing Message:** "You now have the complete skill stack. You have vision, business architecture, self-knowledge, brain science, audience strategy, craft mastery, effortless effectiveness, and a model for turning your philosophy into a sold-out offer. The summit is where you take this to the next level — in person, with a community of people doing the same work."

## Why This Sequence Works
1. **Narrative Arc:** Vision → Business → Self → Brain → Execution → Craft → Ease → Mastery
2. **Prerequisite Logic:** Each workshop builds on the previous one. Vision before business. Business before self-work. Self-work before brain science. Brain science before execution. Execution before craft. Craft before ease. Ease before mastery.
3. **Gender Balance:** 4 men (Dan Koe, Taylin, David, Dan G) and 4 women (Kimia, Hussain*, Logan*, Olivia) — *confirm genders
4. **Diverse Audience Accommodation:**
  - Beginners get the full journey from philosophy to execution
  - Experienced creators get the deeper layers (David, Kimia, Dan G, Olivia)
  - People without niches discover them through the self-work (David) and business architecture (Taylin)
5. **Summit Funnel:** By week 8, participants have experienced 8 of the summit's key speakers and understand the "future-proof skill stack" concept. They're primed to buy summit tickets.
6. **Emotional Pacing:** The sequence balances philosophical grounding (Dan K, Dan G, Olivia) with tactical execution (Taylin, Hussain, Logan) with introspection and science (David, Kimia).
7. **Locked-In Speakers:** Dan Koe and Taylin Simmonds are confirmed for weeks 1-2, providing a strong opening that establishes both the vision and the business foundation.

## The Future-Proof Transformation Contest
### Overview
The contest runs alongside the 8-week workshop series and rewards the participant who demonstrates the most visible transformation across all 8 weeks. It's designed to drive genuine engagement, create organic marketing content, and produce a powerful testimonial for future summits.
---
### The Prize
**If the winner has a GA ticket:**
- Free upgrade to VIP ($700 value — the difference between GA at $299 and VIP at $999)
- VIP includes: exclusive Saturday dinner with speakers, front-row seating, after-party ticket, and 2 years of Premium Living Internet University membership
**If the winner already has a VIP ticket:**
- A free VIP ticket to bring a friend ($999 value)
- Their friend gets the full VIP experience alongside them
In both cases, the winner's prize is worth between $700–$999 USD and directly deepens their connection to the summit community.
---
### How to Enter
To be eligible, participants must:
1. **Hold a GA or VIP ticket** to the Future-Proof Creator Summit (June 5–7, 2026)
2. **Attend each of the 8 workshops** — either live or by watching the recorded replay
3. **Post a reel on Instagram or a video on YouTube** after each workshop describing how they are applying what they learned in their own life or business
4. **Tag** `#livinginternetuniversity` and `@living.internet.alliance` in every post
5. **Post for all 8 workshops** — missing even one disqualifies the entry
There is no application form. Eligibility is verified through the tagged posts.
---
### How the Winner is Selected
At the end of the 8-week series, all 8 workshop speakers review the eligible entries and vote on **one winner** based on a single criterion:
> **Most visible transformation across the 8 weeks**
Speakers are looking for:
- Genuine, honest documentation of their journey (not polished production)
- Real-world application of what they learned — not just summaries
- Evidence of growth, breakthroughs, and honest struggle
- A story arc that shows who they were in week 1 vs. who they are in week 8
The winner is announced at the summit — ideally on stage — making their story part of the event itself.
---
### Why This Contest Works
**For participants:**
- Creates accountability to show up for every workshop
- Forces them to articulate and apply what they're learning (deepens retention)
- Builds their personal brand in public (the posts are content for their own audience)
- The prize directly upgrades their summit experience
**For the series:**
- Every tagged post is organic marketing for the series and the summit
- The hashtag creates a searchable content trail across Instagram and YouTube
- The winner's transformation story becomes a powerful testimonial
- Speaker involvement in voting gives them a stake in participant outcomes
**For the summit:**
- The winner's story can be featured on stage, in marketing, and in post-event content
- The contest creates a community narrative — participants follow each other's journeys
- It seeds the summit with highly engaged, transformation-oriented attendees

### Suggested Announcement Copy (for Week 1)
> "We're running a contest across all 8 workshops. Post a reel or YouTube video after each session showing how you're applying what you learned. Tag #livinginternetuniversity and @living.internet.alliance. Do it for all 8 workshops and you're eligible. At the end, our 8 speakers will vote on the participant who showed the most visible transformation. The winner gets a free VIP upgrade — or if you're already VIP, a free ticket to bring a friend. This isn't about the most polished content. It's about the most honest journey."
---
### Notes & Considerations
1. **Verification:** Have participants submit a simple Google Form at the end with links to all 8 posts, making it easy for speakers to review
2. **Tie-breaking:** If speakers are split, the series host casts the deciding vote
3. **Runner-up recognition:** Consider giving 2nd and 3rd place a shout-out at the summit even without a prize — it rewards effort and creates goodwill
4. **Privacy:** Make clear from the start that public posting is a requirement, not optional
5. **International/virtual participants:** The contest is open to all ticket holders regardless of location — virtual ticket holders are eligible too
---
## Implementation Notes
1. **Live Format:** Each workshop should be 60-90 minutes: 45-60 min teaching + 15-30 min Q&A
2. **Homework/Continuity:** The contest posts serve as the accountability mechanism between workshops
3. **Community Building:** Use the recorded replay access to build momentum toward the summit. Create a private community where participants can share their progress and follow each other's contest journeys
4. **Summit Bridge:** In week 8, explicitly position the summit as the "next level" where they'll go deeper with this community and meet all the speakers in person
5. **Testimonials:** Capture participant wins from weeks 1-7 and use them in summit marketing
6. **Timing:** With 8 weeks of workshops, launch the series approximately 9-10 weeks before June 5 (i.e., late March/early April 2026)
